        'SWYT (Stop Wasting Your Time) is a Chrome extension developed in JavaScript. It allows users to limit the time spent each day watching YouTube Shorts. The user can choose a daily time limit, and the extension will track the time spent watching YouTube Shorts. If the limit is exceeded, the extension will redirect the user and prevent them from watching more Shorts until the next day. This personal project allows me to develop a useful tool while also exploring Chrome extension development (including manifests and the Chrome API).',
