The user can choose a daily time limit, and the extension will track the time spent watching YouTube Shorts. If the limit is exceeded, the extension will redirect the user and prevent them from watching more Shorts until the next day. This personal project allows me to develop a useful tool while also exploring Chrome extension development (including manifests and the Chrome API).',

It was a bit challenging due to the lack of documentation and extensive tutorials, but it was very rewarding to manage to create a functional addon that I use daily in the game.',

The goal was to create a website allowing laboratory members to view the CO2 emissions they generated from their professional travel. The project also involved organizing data from several .csv files into a local database using Python. Once this was done, I was able to code the website, utilizing technologies such as Tailwind, Parcel, and ChartJS. The site allows for visualizing emissions globally, by individual, department, and team, as well as making predictions for future years. I coded the site and the Python scripts entirely on my own, with the help and guidance of two mentors. It was a very enriching experience, both technically and personally, as I was able to work on every aspect of a project and use any technology I wished, and contribute to an ecological cause. Due to the sensitivity of the data, both the website and the Github are private, and the image is obfuscated.',
